# ML-models-for-Healthcare
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts healthcare outcomes based on patient inputs. The model is deployed serverlessly using AWS Lambda and connected through an API Gateway. A simple frontend is also created to collect user inputs and display predictions in real-time.

## Features
- Machine Learning model trained on healthcare data.
- Serverless deployment using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Model exported using joblib for portability.
- Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend connected to API.
- Real-time disease or cost prediction.
- Scalable, lightweight, and cost-effective setup.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib, Numpy)
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS S3 (for deployment storage)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- GitHub for version control
