# ML-models-for-Healthcare
This project is focused on building a lightweight, scalable machine learning system that predicts healthcare outcomes (such as disease presence or cost prediction) based on patient inputs. It combines machine learning model training, cloud deployment using AWS Lambda, and frontend integration to create an end-to-end, accessible solution.
